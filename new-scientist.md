Quotes https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/21/9/1673/992111, in particular:

    Polyginy is known to be substantially higher among FPPs than among HGPs, 
    both in terms of proportion of polygamists and in terms of average number 
    of wives per polygamist (Cavalli-Sforza 1986a; Biesele and Royal 1999). 
    Furthermore, whereas all FPPs practice a rigid patrilocality, some 
    HGPs do not exclusively follow such social behavior.
